## Welcome to Finsightful - Financial and Integrated report Insight Generator

In the fast-paced world of financial reporting, accessing accurate and timely information is key to making informed decisions. To address this need, I’ve built a state-of-the-art application using Haystack and Chainlit. This application leverages the power of conversational AI to provide users with detailed insights from financial reports created using XBRL and other markup languages.

At the heart of this application is a conversational agent that I’ve designed to understand and respond to user queries in a natural, conversational manner. It uses an advanced AI model to generate responses, ensuring that the insights provided are both accurate and relevant.

One of the standout features of this application is its ability to query financial reports in XBRL format. XBRL, or eXtensible Business Reporting Language, is a global standard for exchanging business information. It’s widely used for corporate reporting, making it a valuable resource for financial analysis.

With this application, you can extract and analyze data from XBRL documents with ease. Whether you’re looking for specific financial figures or general trends, this application can provide you with the information you need in an easy-to-understand format.
